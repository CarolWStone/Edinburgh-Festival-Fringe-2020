Our data comes from the Edinburgh Festivals Listings API. We use Python for data analysis. For assignment 3, we further analyse the activities from different countries, activities that provide accessible services, activities that give different age categories, and the warnings provided by activities. For our final creation, We did an in-depth analysis of accessible services and age categories, and we separately combined these two factors with other meaningful information in the data. 
 
Based on our analysis, we create an infographic, with our findings and interactive charts, please see this link: https://infogram.com/fringe-festival-data-fair-2020-1h7v4pwnozx7j6k?live
