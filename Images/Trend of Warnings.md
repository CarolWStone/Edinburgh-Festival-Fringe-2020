# Description

The x-axis indicates the frequency of warnings, and the y-axis indicates the warnings with high frequency. The chart shows the top ten warnings that appear frequently from 2015 to 2019. Users can interact with chart by checking the year box.

# Shortcoming

By clicking on the year box, users cannot quickly see the trend of warning changes, so we decided to display it in the form of animation.

# Update

The speed of the animation has been re-adjusted to make it more suitable for reading.
