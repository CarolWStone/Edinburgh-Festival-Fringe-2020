# Description

These charts show the percentage of accessible shows from 2017 to 2019. 'TRUE' represents the percentage of shows that provide accessibility services each year.

# Shortcoming

Four separate diagrams cannot make users intuitively understand their connections.

# Update

In order to make the content of the chart easier to compare and save space, we used the method of combining these content in the same chart to display the data from 2012 to 2015.
