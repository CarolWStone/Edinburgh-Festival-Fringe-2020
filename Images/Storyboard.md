# Storyboard explanation

Our storyboard describes that an art group wanted to participate in the fringe festival, but they have many questions about it. When they found our webpage, they learned a lot of relevant information through these data visualizations. Finally, they improved their program and achieved a successful performance.


# Storyboard reflection

According to the feedback from data holder , the target users should be included:

* Academics in Cultural and Creative Industries.
* Fringe staff
* The public and cultural workers, via media reports in newspapers, blog posts, etc

It means that in our storyboard,  the characters should be broader. In addition, we should make the theme of the web page clearer
